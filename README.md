## Overview
Air Pollution Analysis in India (2018‚Äì2022)
This Power BI project presents a comprehensive analysis of major air pollutants ‚Äî <b> SO‚ÇÇ, NO‚ÇÇ, PM2.5, and PM10 </b>‚Äî across various regions in India from 2018 to 2022. The main objectives are to:

- Identify pollution trends over time

- Analyze changes in the Air Quality Index (AQI)

- Highlight instances where pollutant levels exceed <b>WHO-recommended limits

The dashboard offers visual insights to support data-driven decisions on environmental health and pollution control measures.
## üîç Key Insights
- PM10</b> and <b>PM2.5</b> levels consistently exceed <b>WHO Air Quality Guideline (AQG)</b> standards, posing major health concerns.

- <b>SO‚ÇÇ </b>levels remain within safe limits across all monitored years.

- <b>Year-over-year trends </b>indicate a slight reduction in <b>NO‚ÇÇ</b> levels, while other pollutants ‚Äî especially PM10 and <b>PM2.5 </b>‚Äî show an increase after 2020.

- <b>Correlation analysis</b> reveals a strong positive relationship between <b>PM10</b> and <b>PM2.5</b>, suggesting common sources or similar contributing factors.
